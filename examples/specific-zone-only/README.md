# Specific Zone Only Example

A simple example to provision a Secure Landing Zone (SLZ) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in a specific zone other than Zone 1. Also, shows how to use public gateways with a specific zone. In this example Zone 2 is used. A network ACL is specifically defined to allow all internet traffic.

The following resources are provisioned by this example:

* A new resource group, if an existing one is not passed in.
* An IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a publicly exposed subnet.
